        website: The tfl api to download traffic camera videos

        cam_file: Stores the last time the camera was modified. The file is checked in ordere to download new videos.

        check_if_video_is_available: if set to True, check the "available" of the camera data to see if it's set to "true" before downloading the video. The json data returned by tfl api contains a key, in the "additionalProperties" field, called "available". Our assumption is that the "available" property means the camera is available and working if the value is "true" and not available otherwise. However, after going through the data, we discovered that some cameras are working when the "available" property is "false".We plan to investigate this before removing the check_if_video_is_available argument.
