# Quantifying London Traffic Dynamics from Traffic Videos 
We present an automated traffic analysis library. Our library provides functionality to 
1. Collect real-time traffic videos from the Transport for London API 
2. Analyse collected videos using computer vision techniques to produce traffic statistics (vehicle counts, vehicle starts, vehicle stops)
3. Deploy a live web app to display collected statistics
4. Evaluate videos (given annotations)

## Introduction

Better insight extraction from traffic data can aid the effort to understand/reduce air pollution, and allow dynamic traffic flow optimization. Currently, traffic statistics (counts of vehicle types, stops, and starts) are obtained through high-cost manual labor (i.e. individuals counting vehicles by the road) and are extrapolated to annual averages. Furthermore, they are not detailed enough to evaluate traffic/air pollution initiatives. 

The purpose of the project is to create an open-source library to automate the collection of live traffic video data, and extract descriptive statistics (counts, stops, and starts by vehicle type)  using computer vision techniques. With this library, project partners will be able to input traffic camera videos, and obtain real-time traffic statistics which are localized to the level of individual streets. 

More details about the project goals, our technical approach, and the evaluation of our models can be found in the **Technical Report**. 

## Overview
Our project is structured into four main pipelines, each of which serves a disctinct function. These pipelines are broadly described as follows:

</p> 

## Infrastructure

All pipelines were run on an AWS EC2 instance and a combination of an AWS S3 bucket and PostgreSQL database were used to store data. The details of the EC2 instance can be found below:
```

## Installation and setup

### Setting up Ubuntu

For installation and setup we are assuming that you are on a Ubuntu system. To start with you should update and upgrade your apt-get package manager.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
Now you can install python 3.6 and the corresponding pip version. To do this run the following commands in order:
```
sudo apt-get install python3.6
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev
```

### Setting Up A Virtual Environment

The next step is to set up a virtual environment for managing all the packages needed for this project. Run the following commands to install virtualenv:
```
python3.6 -m pip install virtualenv
```
With virtualenv installed we can now create a new environment for our packages. To do this we can run the following commands (where 'my_env' is your chosen name for the environment):
```
python3.6 -m virtualenv my_env
```
Whenever you want to run our pipelines you need to remember to activate this environment so that all the necessary packages are present. To do this you can run the command below: 
```
source my_env/bin/activate
```
Run this command now because in the next step we will clone the repo and download all the packages we need into the 'my_env' environment.

### Clone The Repo

To clone our repo and download all of our code run the following commands:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/dssg/air_pollution_estimation.git
```

### Installing Packages

All of the required packages for this project are in the 'requirements.txt' file. To install the packages run the following commands:
```
cd air_pollution_estimation/
sudo apt-get install -y libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev libpq-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install psycopg2
```

### Set Up Credentials File

With the repo cloned and the packages installed the next step is to create your private credentials file that will allow you to log into the different AWS services. This file lives in conf/local/ and is not tracked by git because it contains personal information. General parameter and path settings live in conf/base/ and are racked by git.

To create the credentials file run the following command:
```
touch conf/local/credentials.yml
```
With the file created, you need to use your preferred text editor (e.g. ```nano conf/local/credentials.yml```) to copy the following template into the file: 
```
dev_s3:
  aws_access_key_id: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE
  aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE

email:
  address: OUTWARD_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  password: EMAIL_PASSWORD
  recipients: ['RECIPIENT_1_EMAIL_ADDRESS', 'RECIPIENT_2_EMAIL_ADDRESS', ...]

postgres:
  host: YOUR_HOST_ADDRESS
  name: YOUR_DB_NAME
  user: YOUR_DB_USER
  passphrase: YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
```
With the template copied, you need to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials. The keys in `credentials.yml` are described below:
* `dev_s3`: This section contains the Amazon S3 credentials. Learn more about setting up an Amazon S3 <a src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html?nc2=h_ql_doc">here</a>
  * `aws_access_key_id`: 
  * `aws_secret_access_key`: 
* `email`: This section is used for email notification service. The email notification service is used to send warnings or messages to recipients when data collection fails.
  * `address`: the email address used to send a mail to the recipients
  * `password`: the password of the email address
  * `recipients`: the list of recipients(email addresses) to be notified
* `postgres`: This section contains the credentials for the PostgreSQL database.
  * `user`: The name of the user in the PostgreSQL database
  * `passphrase`: The passphrase of the above user for the PostgreSQL database

In addition to the credentials file you also need to enter your AWS credentials using the AWS command line tool. To do this run the following command:
```
aws configure --profile dssg
```
When prompted enter your AWS access key ID and your secret access key (these will be the same as the ones you entered in the ```credentials.yml``` file). For the default region name and output format just press enter to leave them blank.

For the final setup step execute the following command to complete the required infrastructure:
``` python src/setup.py```

## 1. Running The Data Collection Pipeline

In order to run the static pipeline you need to collect raw video data from the TFL API. **You therefore need to run the data collection pipeline before the static pipeline will work**. The data collection pipeline continuously grabs videos from the TFL API and puts them in the S3 bucket for future analysis. The longer you leave the data collection pipeline to run the more data you will have to analyse!

Run the following command to run the pipeline: 
```
python src/data_collection_pipeline.py
```
As long as this process is running you will be downloading the latest JamCam videos and uploading them to the S3 bucket. The videos will be collected from all the camera and stored in folders based on their date of collection.

### Optional parameters for data collection pipeline
The optional parameters for the data collection pipeline include:

* `iterations`: The data collection pipeline script downloads videos from TFL continuously when `iterations` is set to `0`. To stop the data collection pipeline after ` N iterations`, change the `iterations` parameter in the `parameters.yml` to `N` where ```N``` is a number e.g

```
iterations: 4
```

* `delay`: The `delay` parameter is the amount of time in minutes for the data collection pipeline to wait between iterations. The default `delay` time is set to `3 mins` because TFL uploads new videos after `~4 mins`. E.g
```
delay: 3
```

## 2. Running The Static Pipeline

The static pipeline is used to analyse a selection of JamCam videos and put the results into the PostgreSQL database. A general outline of static pipeline can be seen in the following diagram:

<p float="left">
  <img src ="readme_resources/images/static_pipeline.png" alt="alt text" />
</p> 

In short, the pipeline first constructs a .json file containing a list of video file paths to be used for analysis. The video paths saved in the .json file are based on a particular search critera (see below). The .json file is uploaded to s3 so that we can avoid searching the videos every time we want to run the pipeline. The next step of the pipeline is to use the .json file to load the corresponding videos into memory and analyse them, producing frame and video level statistics in the PostgreSQL database.

To run the pipeline execute the following command in the terminal:

``` python src/run_pipeline.py```

Under 'static_pipeline' heading in the ```parameters.yml``` file is a collection of parameters that are used to control which videos are saved to the .json file. These parameters are as follows:

* `load_ref_file` - Boolean for flagging whether to create a new .json file or load an existing one
* `ref_file_name` - The name of the ref file that will be saved and/or loaded
* `camera_list` - A list of camera IDs specifying the camera to analyse
* `from_date` - The date to start analysing videos from
* `to_date` - The date to stop analysing videos from
* `from_time` - The time of day to start analysing videos from
* `to_time` - THe time of day to stop analysing videos from

To edit these parameters you can use your favourite text editor e.g. (e.g. `nano conf/local/credentials.yml`). Remember this pipeline assumes that you have already collected videos that satisfy the requirements specified by your parameter settings.

If the search parameters are `None` then they default to the following:

* `camera_list` - Defaults to all of the cameras if `None`<br/>
* `from_date` - Defaults to `"2019-06-01"` if `None`<br/>
* `to_date` - Defaults to the current date if `None`<br/>
* `from_time` - Defaults to `"00-00-00"` if `None`<br/>
* `to_time` - Defaults to `"23-59-59"` if `None`

Aside from the parameters that define the search criteria for the videos to be analysed, there are a host of other parameters in ```parameters.yml``` that affect the static pipeline. These parameters can be found under the 'modelling' heading (see the 'Key Files' section for more information about these parameters).

The output of the static pipeline is appended to the frame and video level tables in the PostgreSQL database. These schemas of these two tables are as follows:

**Frame Level Schema**
<p float="left">
  <img src ="readme_resources/images/frame_schema.png" alt="alt text" />
</p>

**Video Level Schema**
<p float="left">
  <img src ="readme_resources/images/video_schema.png" alt="alt text" />
</p>


- information about the camera ID




## 3. Running The Live Pipeline

The live pipeline integrates data collection with video analysis to provide real-time traffic statistics. Every 4 minutes the pipeline grabs the latest videos from the cameras listed in the ```parameters.yml``` file under ```data_collection: tims_camera_list:``` and analyses them. The results are stored in the frame-level and video-level tables in the PostgreSQL database.

To run the pipeline execute the following command in the terminal:

``` python src/cron_job.py```

## 4. Running The Evaluation Pipeline

The evaluation pipeline is used to evaluate the performance of different analyser models and their respective parameter settings. The pipeline relies on hand annotated videos from the computer software *Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT)*. We used version 0.4.2 of CVAT to annotate traffic videos for evaluation. Instructions on installing and running CVAT can be found on their [website](https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md#windows-10). 

For each video, we labelled cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes, and vans; for each object labelled, we annotated whether it was stopped or parked. For consistency we used the following instructions to annotate ground-truth videos with the CVAT tool:

Use the video name as the task name so that it dumps with the same naming convention<br/>
- As a rule of thumb, label things inside the bottom 2/3rds of the image. But if a vehicle is very obvious in the top 1/3rd, label it.<br/>
- Use the following labels when creating a CVAT task:<br/>
vehicle ~checkbox=parked:false ~checkbox=stopped:false @select=type:undefined,car,truck,bus,motorbike,van<br/>
- Set Image Quality to 95<br/>
- Draw boxes around key frames and let CVAT perform the interpolation<br/>
- Press the button that looks like an eye to specify when the object is no longer in the image<br/>
- Save work before dumping task to an xml file.<br/>

Once you have the xml files containing your annotations you need to put them in your S3 bucket according to the path ```s3_annotations``` in the ```paths.yml``` file. It is important that you have the raw videos that corespond to these annotations in the S3 directory indicated by ```s3_video``` in the ```paths.yml``` file. These raw videos will be used by the pipeline to generate predictions that will then be evaluated against the annotations in the xml files. As an example of how the evaluation process works we use the ```setup.py``` script that you ran earlier to put some example videos and annotations in your S3 bucket so that the pipeline will run.

As our approach outputs both video level and frame level statistics, we perform evaluation on both the video level and the frame level. As our models did not produce statistics for vans or indicate whether a vehicle was parked, these statistics are omitted from the evaluation process. 

Video level evaluation is performed for all vehicle-types (cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes) and vehicle statistics (counts, stops, starts) produced by our model. For each combination of vehicle type and vehicle statistics (e.g. car counts, car stops, car starts) we computed the following summary statistics over the evaluation data set:

- Mean absolute error<br/>
- Root mean square error<br/>

As speed was a primary consideration for our project partners, we also evaluated the average runtime for each model. 

Frame level evaluation is performed for all vehicle types produced by our model. For each vehicle type and for each video, we compute the mean average precision. Mean average precision is a standard metric used by the computer vision community to evaluate the performance of object detection/object tracking algorithms. Essentially, this performance metric assesses both how well an algorithm detects existing objects as well as how accurately placed the bounding boxes around these objects are. 

In the context of our project, mean average precision could be utilized to interrogate video-level model performance and diagnose issues. However, as video level statistics were the primary deliverable to our project partners, we used video level performance to select the best models. 

Modifiable model parameters can be found in the ```parameters.yml``` file under ```modelling:```. A description of these parameters can be found in the above section (Static Pipeline).

To run the evaluation pipeline you just need to execute the following command:

```python src/eval_pipeline.py```
